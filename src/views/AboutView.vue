        <strong>software engineering</strong> with web development to deliver <strong>high-performance, user-friendly solutions</strong>.

        My academic journey started with <strong>2 years of Computer Science GCSE</strong>, followed by <strong>2 years of IT in college</strong>,
        <strong>1 year of Computer Science at the University of Hertfordshire</strong>, and <strong>3 years studying Games Programming at
        Bournemouth University</strong>. This foundation provided me with strong <strong>problem-solving abilities</strong> and a keen
        understanding of both the <strong>front and back end</strong> of development.
